# Introduction

Welcome to the **Evolvtech UI Kit**, a component library inspired by the WFP UI Kit. This Storybook contains reusable React components built with TypeScript and styled to match the design system.

## Key Features

- **Component Library**: A collection of reusable React components with consistent styling.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures components work across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Accessible**: Built with accessibility best practices in mind.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to meet different project requirements.

## Installation

To use this UI Kit in your project, install it via npm:

```bash
npm install evolvtech-ui-kit
```

## Usage
Here's an example of how to use one of the components:
```bash
import { Button } from 'evolvtech-ui-kit';

export const App = () => (
  <Button label="Click me" onClick={() => alert('Button clicked!')} />
);
```

### 2. **Add the Story to Storybook**
   - This `Introduction.stories.mdx` file will automatically be picked up by Storybook based on your configuration in `.storybook/main.ts`.

### 3. **Commit the Changes**
   - Add and commit the new introduction story:
```bash
git add src/stories/Introduction.stories.mdx
git commit -m "Add introduction page to Storybook"
```

### 4. **Restart Storybook**
   - Restart Storybook to see the new introduction page:
```bash
npm run storybook
 ```

This will create a similar introduction page as found in the WFP UI Kit documentation. Let me know if you want to customize it further!
